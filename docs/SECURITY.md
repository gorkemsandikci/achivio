# Achivio Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures, threat model, and audit findings for the Achivio smart contract system.

## Security Overview

Achivio implements multiple layers of security to protect user funds, prevent fraud, and ensure system integrity. The security model focuses on:

- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions and authorization
- **Anti-Fraud Protection**: Preventing double rewards and manipulation
- **Economic Security**: Protecting token economics and user balances
- **Emergency Response**: Pause mechanisms and recovery procedures

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats

#### 1. Double Reward Attacks
**Threat**: Users attempting to claim multiple rewards for the same task completion
**Impact**: Token inflation and unfair advantage
**Mitigation**: Daily completion tracking with timestamp validation

#### 2. Unauthorized Token Minting
**Threat**: Malicious actors attempting to mint ACHIV tokens
**Impact**: Token supply manipulation and economic damage
**Mitigation**: Authorized minter system with strict access controls

#### 3. NFT Badge Fraud
**Threat**: Creating fake achievement badges without meeting requirements
**Impact**: Devaluation of legitimate achievements
**Mitigation**: Milestone verification and authorized minting

#### 4. Room Item Exploitation
**Threat**: Purchasing items without proper payment or badge requirements
**Impact**: Economic loss and unfair access to premium features
**Mitigation**: Payment verification and badge requirement checks

#### 5. Leaderboard Manipulation
**Threat**: Fake statistics to gain unfair leaderboard positions
**Impact**: Compromised social features and user trust
**Mitigation**: Validated statistics and cross-contract verification

#### 6. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
**Threat**: Code bugs leading to fund loss or system compromise
**Impact**: User fund loss and system failure
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, audits, and formal verification

## Security Measures

### 1. Access Control System

#### Contract Ownership
```clarity
(define-constant CONTRACT_OWNER tx-sender)

;; Owner-only functions protected by assertion
(asserts! (is-eq tx-sender CONTRACT_OWNER) ERR_OWNER_ONLY)
```

#### Authorized Minter System
```clarity
;; Only authorized contracts can mint tokens
(define-map authorized-minters principal bool)

(define-public (add-authorized-minter (minter principal))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender CONTRACT_OWNER) ERR_OWNER_ONLY)
    (ok (map-set authorized-minters minter true))
  )
)
```

#### Role-Based Permissions
- **Contract Owner**: Full administrative control
- **Authorized Minters**: Can mint tokens/NFTs within limits
- **Users**: Can interact with their own assets only
- **Public Functions**: Limited to safe operations

### 2. Anti-Fraud Protection

#### Daily Completion Limits
```clarity
;; Prevent double rewards per day
(define-map user-task-completions
  { user: principal, task-id: uint, date: uint }
  { completed-at: uint, reward-earned: uint }
)

;; Check if already completed today
(asserts! (not (is-task-completed-today tx-sender task-id)) 
          ERR_TASK_ALREADY_COMPLETED)
```

#### Timestamp Validation
```clarity
;; Use block height for consistent time tracking
(define-read-only (get-current-date)
  (/ block-height u144) ;; ~144 blocks per day
)
```

#### Input Validation
```clarity
;; Comprehensive parameter validation
(asserts! (> amount u0) ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT)
(asserts! (is-standard recipient) ERR_INVALID_RECIPIENT)
(asserts! (and (>= difficulty u1) (<= difficulty u5)) ERR_INVALID_DIFFICULTY)
```

### 3. Economic Security

#### Token Supply Controls
```clarity
;; Track total rewards distributed
(define-data-var total-rewards-distributed uint u0)

;; Update on every mint
(var-set total-rewards-distributed 
  (+ (var-get total-rewards-distributed) amount))
```

#### Deflationary Mechanisms
```clarity
;; Burn tokens for room item purchases
(define-public (purchase-item (template-id uint))
  (begin
    ;; Burn ACHIV tokens as payment
    (try! (contract-call? .achiv-token burn price tx-sender))
    ;; Mint room item NFT
    (try! (nft-mint? room-item new-item-id tx-sender))
  )
)
```

#### Balance Protection
```clarity
;; Prevent overdrafts
(asserts! (>= (ft-get-balance achiv-token sender) amount) 
          ERR_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE)
```

### 4. Emergency Response

#### Pause Mechanisms
```clarity
;; Contract-wide pause functionality
(define-data-var contract-paused bool false)

(define-public (pause-contract)
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender CONTRACT_OWNER) ERR_OWNER_ONLY)
    (ok (var-set contract-paused true))
  )
)

;; Check pause status in all critical functions
(asserts! (not (var-get contract-paused)) ERR_CONTRACT_PAUSED)
```

#### Administrative Controls
- Emergency pause for all contracts
- Authorized minter management
- Task deactivation capabilities
- Upgrade preparation mechanisms

### 5. Data Integrity

#### State Consistency
```clarity
;; Atomic operations with proper error handling
(define-public (complete-task (task-id uint))
  (let ((reward-amount (get reward-amount task-data)))
    (begin
      ;; All validations first
      (asserts! (not (is-task-completed-today tx-sender task-id)) 
                ERR_TASK_ALREADY_COMPLETED)
      
      ;; Atomic state updates
      (map-set user-task-completions ...)
      (map-set user-profiles ...)
      (try! (contract-call? .achiv-token mint-reward ...))
      
      (ok reward-amount)
    )
  )
)
```

#### Cross-Contract Validation
```clarity
;; Verify badge ownership before special purchases
(asserts! 
  (contract-call? .nft-badges user-owns-badge-type tx-sender required-badge)
  ERR_BADGE_REQUIREMENT_NOT_MET
)
```
