- **Deflationary Mechanics**: Token burning through purchases
- **Reward Distribution**: 70% user rewards, 15% streak bonuses, 10% development, 5% reserve
- **Anti-Inflation**: Controlled minting through authorized contracts only

### Gamification System
- **Daily Habits**: Custom task creation with configurable rewards
- **Streak Bonuses**: Increasing rewards for consecutive completions
- **Achievement Badges**: NFT rewards for milestones (7, 14, 30, 60, 100, 365 days)
- **Level System**: User progression based on total tasks completed
- **3D Virtual Rooms**: Customizable workspace with earned furniture

### Social Features
- **Leaderboards**: Multiple ranking categories and timeframes
- **User Comparisons**: Direct competition between users
- **Public Profiles**: Optional social sharing of achievements
- **Achievement Sharing**: Social proof of habit consistency

### Security Features
- **Anti-Fraud Protection**: Daily completion limits with timestamp validation
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions and authorized minters
- **Emergency Mechanisms**: Contract pause functionality
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking
- **Economic Security**: Balance protection and supply controls

## üîí Security Measures Implemented

### Access Control
